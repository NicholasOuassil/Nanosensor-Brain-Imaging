# Nanosensor-Brain-Imaging

## Introduction

Nanosensor-Brain-Imaging is a suite of MATLAB code designed specifically for processing brain tissue imaging data and quantifying the fluorescent response of infrared fluorescent nanosensors. It provides a convenient GUI for processing TIF and SPE image stacks to generate dF/F fluorescent time traces for ROIs. ROIs are automatically generated by thresholding pixels with high variance (standard deviation) in their fluorescence intensity.

## Tutorial

*### Opening the Interface
1.  Download the nanosensor_brain_imaging package, unpack and add it to your MATLAB path.
    * Remember to update to the latest version of the software to ensure optimal results

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `Nanosensor-Brain-Imaging` folder.

3. Open the GUI by running the `nanosensor_imaging_GUI.m` file


The result should look like this: ![opening the gui result](readme_images/opening_the_GUI_result.png)  <br>

### Processing Videos

1. Define filetype (SPE or TIF)
    * TIF should be checked by default
    * Landry Lab standard is TIF
    
2. Click on ***Load Stack*** button and select the your file of choice.
    * This should be the same filetype as you selected
    * A file browser window should open
    At this point your interface should look something like this after the file loads: ![Load Stack Result](readme_images/load_stack_result.png)

3. Select Parameters for Regions of Interest (ROI)
    * Set the ***Frame Rate*** of your video 
        * Landry Lab standard is 8.33 Hz (default setting)
    * Set ***Threshold Level*** 
        * Values below this number of  % Change in fluorescence will be ignored.
    * Adjust ***Struct Elmnt Size*** and ***IMopen Repeats*** to desired values
        * Description to come 
    *  **Optional:** If Grid ROIs are desired set ***Grid ROI Size***
        * As noted, the unit of this is pixels. The numerical value imputed will be the size of each grid. 
        * Be careful at low values the image looks like a soup of colors 
    * **Note:** At this point nothing should change with the central graph
    
4. Click ***Generate ROI Mask*** or ***Generate ROI Grid*** depending on desired mask generation method.
    * **Note:** This may take a few seconds
    * ROI Mask ![ROI Mask Result](readme_images/ROI_mask_result.png)
    *  ROI Grid ![ROI Grid Result](readme_images/ROI_grid_result.png)
    
5. **Optional:**  Save or Load ROI Mask by clicking their respective buttons
    * Save will output a `.mat` file
    * Despite name this function works with both the Grid and Mask ROI Techniques    

6. Click ***Process File***
    * The result should look like this. ![Process File Result](readme_images/process_file_result.png)

**Note:** Batch Process is for individual images rather than a video.
